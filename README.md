# Weather-App

## Description

I created a weather app that is designed to allow a user to input the name of a city where the weather data for that city comes up for the current day as well as for the upcoming 5 days. City searches will be saved into convenient button links on the right side of the page so the user can click the button for the previously searched cities and see the forcast even after having exited the site.
